# Project Overview

This project provided hands-on experience in managing Active Directory (AD) for user administration, combined with AWS cloud services. The main objective was to simulate a real-world helpdesk environment where I could perform tasks like resetting passwords, creating and deleting user accounts, and adding users to appropriate groups. By integrating AWS, I enhanced the security and scalability of the environment, simulating the real-world use of both on-premise and cloud-based IT solutions.

# Key Objectives:

Active Directory Management
Gain practical experience managing user accounts, passwords, and access rights through Active Directory. Key tasks included:

Password Resets: Handling user requests for forgotten or expired passwords.

User Account Creation & Deletion: Creating new user accounts and removing inactive or unnecessary accounts.

Group Management: Adding users to the appropriate AD groups based on roles or permissions.

AWS Integration
Leverage AWS to enhance the environment with cloud-based resources and secure access management:

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Integrated IAM to manage user roles and permissions for access to cloud resources.

AWS EC2 Instances: Deployed virtual servers for hosting and managing AD-related tasks in a scalable, cloud-based setup.

# Core Tasks & Tools:

Active Directory Management
User Account Creation & Deletion

Created new AD user accounts for onboarding employees or contractors.

Deleted accounts for users who no longer required access to the network.

Managed user accounts through Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC).

Password Resets

Responded to user password reset requests and implemented them through ADUC.

Ensured users could regain access to their accounts while maintaining security protocols.

Group Management

Added users to the appropriate AD groups based on their role and access requirements.

Managed security groups to control user access to resources and systems.

AWS Integration
AWS IAM for Access Control

Used AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define roles and permissions for users requiring access to AWS services.

Configured permissions to ensure users had secure access to the necessary resources.

AWS EC2 Instances

Set up EC2 instances to create a virtualized environment for Active Directory management.

Enabled remote management of user accounts and group memberships through cloud-based resources.

# Skills Gained:

Active Directory Administration: Gained practical experience in managing AD users, groups, and security policies.

AWS Cloud Services: Implemented IAM policies and configured EC2 instances to enhance AD-related operations in a cloud environment.

Security Best Practices: Ensured secure management of user accounts and group permissions, both on-prem and in the cloud.

# Tools & Technologies:

Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)

AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

AWS EC2 (Cloud Servers)

# Project Outcome:

This project provided a practical understanding of managing user accounts and permissions within Active Directory, while also leveraging AWS for scalable, secure infrastructure. It helped solidify my skills in system administration, user management, and cloud integration. I now have the capability to handle user requests, manage security groups, and work in both local and cloud-based environments, making me well-prepared for IT support and cloud-focused roles.

# Conclusion:

By combining hands-on experience with Active Directory and AWS, this project gave me valuable exposure to modern IT operations. It deepened my understanding of user management, security, and cloud infrastructure, preparing me for a variety of roles in system administration and IT support.
